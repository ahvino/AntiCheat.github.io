                A constant problem for developers who try to counter cheat developers is that it’s not a problem that
                is resolved from a single deployment of updates. Cheat software is constantly being updated to adapt 
                to the current game and so very quickly, a game’s anti-cheat software is exploited by cheat developers 
                and new ways of exploiting are found and used in new cheats. AI software is currently showing promise 
                in helping to mitigate this issue.

            <p style="border-width:90px; color:rgb(34, 37, 46); font-size:22px; font-family:'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif">
                One of the companies combating cheat developers is SARD Anti-Cheat. SARD is a anti cheat that empowers 
                the developers to ensure the integrity required for fair play within a game.  Though controversial, SARD
                 leverages kernel-based tools on top of their AI and ML modules to provide future proof game security. 
                 This means that an anti-cheat may still be viable regardless of updates to the cheat software. If the 
                 anti-cheat software is able to adapt and improve itself, the cheat developer’s product becomes significantly
                 less reliable.  Again, the fact that this is kernel based does cause some concern. Kernel level anti cheat 
                 provides full access to all the hardware and software on your machine. It’s not unreasonable to think that
                 this could lead to potentially serious issues. If the kernel-level anti cheat is affected in some way, 
                 this could leave all users who use cheats and also those who don’t vulnerable. It’s very possible that
                 you may have caused a more serious issue with the addition of any type of kernel based anti-cheat.  
                 Having said all this, SARD still might be a necessary evil for some developers who may not be able to
                 have a game without a more robust anti-cheat. If the overall community is better for it, even with all 
                 the risks in place, then ethically, a developer may be justified in its use.

            <p style="border-width:90px; color:rgb(34, 37, 46); font-size:22px; font-family:'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif">
                One concern people might have regarding Waldo vision is that the system creates a biometric profile that 
                can be used to determine who a particular player is regardless of the game being played. So if you play 
                a particular game for over a year, your profile could follow you to a new game you’ve just picked up. 
                People may find concern in that a profile that is deemed to be cheating means that you may not just be 
                banned from the game that you actually cheated in but you could also be banned in other games based off 
                your profile. This may not take into account things like account recoveries. An account recovery is when 
                a player gives someone else their account to play on. This is usually because the player offering up their
                account may not have a high enough skill for certain items or rewards in a game. Though this is usually 
                frowned upon it’s categorized different from cheating; however, it’s very likely that the person performing
                the recovery could be using cheats in order to achieve the task at hand. In this scenario, we may be 
                permanently banning the player who offered up the account while the player who actually used the cheats 
                receives no punishment at all. This is obviously something that would need to be considered.
