                With the ever-increasing popularity of video games, there has also been a dramatic increase in cheats
                and cheat software. At present some of the development companies behind the making of the cheat software
                are making millions of dollars annually. According to a Vice article, one of the most popular cheat 
                developer organizations, “raked in $77 million from selling cheats”. There has obviously been a 
                significant incentive for cheat developers to continually develop these cheats, but they cause 
                significant harm to a game’s player base. There currently is a wide variety of anti-cheat software but so
                far, it’s been a losing battle. Already, these cheat developers are using AI technology in their software
                to make things less hospitable for players who play fairly, luckily, AI is now also being leveraged to detect cheats.
